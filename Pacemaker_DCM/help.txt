2. Click spinner arrows to change values of each parameter.
    - you cannot edit hysteresis rate limit or rate smoothing percent when they are disabled
    - lower rate limit can't be larger than upper rate limit
    - hysteresis rate limit can't be larger than lower rate limit

        - saving again will overwrite the previous file
        - each user MUST save default values before loading
    - exported values are stored in /ExportedParameters/
        - can store as many exported values, each with their unique name
        - each file is tagged with a unix time code, so there is version history

    - exported values are loaded from wherever user specifies through file chooser window
