3K04 GROUP 8'S PACEMAKER DCM PROGRAM

1. Select a serial port and press "Connect" button to connect to it.
    - The button will be disabled until port is fully connected to.
    - When it's successfully connected, a checkmark should appear on the bottom left.
    - If the serial number received from the device is garbage characters, you may have to relaunch the program.

2. Refresh ports.
    - Will disconnect from any currently connected port.
    - Will refresh the combo box to show all available serial ports.

2. Press spinner arrows to change values of each parameter.
    - Lower rate limit can't be larger than max sensor rate.
    - Each parameter has it's own unique step size and range.
    - Input fields will be enabled/disabled whether they're needed by the respective pacing mode.

3. "Send Parameters to Pacemaker"
    - Will parse all values from input fields and send them to connected serial port.
    - The connected pacemaker will echo the data to ensure data was sent correctly.
    - If there was any error, a dialog message window will prompt the user.
    - This may stall the EGRAM occasionally.

4. "View Parameters from Pacemaker"
    - Prompts the pacemaker to echo the values that are loaded onto the hardware.
    - Values will be displayed in a dialog message window for user to see.

5. "View Electrogram"
    - Will open a window that graphs the voltages of the atrial and ventricular signals.
    - This will constantly run in the background, and exiting the window will only hide it.
        - This process will not disturb any functionality of the DCM.

5. Load nominal values for each parameter by pressing "Load Nominal".
    - These values are hard-coded into the program (they will never change).

6. Save default parameters or export parameters with their respective buttons.
    - Default values are stored in /DefaultParameters/
        - Only one set of default values is stored per user.
        - Saving again will overwrite the previous settings.
        - Each user MUST save default values at least once before loading them.
    - Exported values are stored in /ExportedParameters/
        - Can store as many exported set of values, each with their unique name.
        - Each file is named with a unix time stamp, so there is version history.

7. Load default parameters or exported parameters with their respective buttons.
    - Default values are loaded from /DefaultParameters/
    - Exported values are loaded from wherever user specifies through file chooser menu.

8. "Edit Users"
    - Can only be viewed by those in ADMIN MODE (logged in as admin).
    - Opens a window that allows admin to freely remove users without knowing their passwords.
    - Can also register users.

8. Press "Logout" to exit the DCM form and go back to login screen.
    - This should safely disconnect the user from any connected serial ports.
    - This frame is then disposed, and should bring you back to login form.
